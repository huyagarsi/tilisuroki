Ironically, the conversations about the sci-fi thriller seem to have <a href=#>followed a similar progression</a>. The movie, Olivia Wilde’s next feature directorial project after Booksmart, made a first impression so appealing that 18 studios competed to buy it in 2019, including winner New Line Cinema. Yet over the past three years, the movie has been plagued by reports of alleged behind-the-scenes drama. At the <a href=#>Venice Film Festival </a>this week, the cast’s every interaction was <a href=#>picked apart</a> for confirmation of tension.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7po8vpp000q3b6x4oyzqzy2@published data-word-count=148>Out in theaters on September 23, Don’t Worry Darling stars Florence Pugh as Alice, a 1950s housewife who begins questioning her life in an isolated California desert town called Victory. <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> replaced Shia LaBeouf as Alice’s husband, Jack, while Wilde stars as another local housewife, Bunny. In this community, women are expected to stay inside while men go work on a mysterious project helmed by a suspicious-looking Chris Pine. Wilde marketed Don’t Worry Darling as a rare showcase of “female pleasure” and seemed to frame the production itself as an empowering workplace — one where her “no assholes” rule could cause LaBeouf’s exit in order to protect Pugh. Below, a timeline of events as audiences became more and more worried about Don’t Worry, Darling, from Wilde’s alleged on-set romance with Styles to a leaked video of her asking LaBeouf if he’d come back if Pugh “really commits.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl7hw89vs002d3b6rxek4abby@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Making (and breaking) a cast</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7hw8tqh002l3b6r17h370zv@published data-word-count=73><strong>April 24, 2020: </strong>Florence Pugh is announced as the lead housewife of Don’t Worry Darling. <a href=#>According to Deadline</a>, the movie will be set in an isolated, seemingly utopian community — not exactly a foreign concept to Pugh, who is coming off a star turn in <a href=#>Midsommar</a>.

Pine takes us through finding out about Spitgate, generating a statement with his publicist, and what really went down at the premiere. Apparently, what the internet viewed as a loogie being hawked was actually Styles sharing an in-joke with Pine. “I think what he said, is he leaned down, and I think he said, ‘It’s just words, isn’t it?’” Pine said. “Because we had this little joke, because we’re all jetlagged, we’re all trying to answer these questions, and sometimes when you’re doing these press things, your brain goes all befuddled, you know, you start speaking gibberish, and we had a joke like, ‘It’s just words, man.’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7qixoui000r3e6qwkw3vxbd@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><p class=subscriber-copy>Thank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism<span id=givenName></span>.
