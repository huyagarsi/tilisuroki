Released in April 1994, it opened at a disappointing seventh at the box office, behind the sequel to Major League, the sequel to The Mighty Ducks, and the second sequel to Naked Gun. It endured <a href=#>some</a> <a href=#>of</a> <a href=#>the</a> <a href=#>most</a> <a href=#>negative</a> <a href=#>reviews</a> a film could ever hope to avoid; in a half-star pan that declared the movie “irredeemably not funny,” Roger Ebert wrote that there was “something extraterrestrial about it, as if it’s based on the sense of humor of an alien race with a completely different relationship to the physical universe.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrc4null002k3h6eqyryzydb@published data-word-count=14>“What we have here is a suitable case for deep cinematic analysis,” Ebert concluded.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrc4null002l3h6ej7r40i9r@published data-word-count=133>Short was 40 when he starred in Clifford, playing the titular ten-year-old character. The effect is unsettling. Clifford is neither boy nor man. He’s a raging storm of desire, chocolate cravings, and Ethel Merman impressions that has assumed human form. Suffice it to say you don’t watch Clifford to go on the hero’s journey. But sure, there’s plot. When his Uncle Martin (<a href=#>Charles Grodin</a> at his prickly best) reneges on a promise to fulfill Clifford’s dream of visiting the Dinosaur World amusement park, Clifford embarks on a sadistic revenge mission to humiliate Uncle Martin in front of his boss (Dabney Coleman) and estrange him from his child-loving fiancée, Miss Sarah Davis (Mary Steenburgen). Moviegoing audiences didn’t take to it. But thanks to <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>persistent airings on basic cable,</span> Clifford built a small, devoted following.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrc4nulm002m3h6exl4jgkot@published data-word-count=70>Twenty-seven years after its release, <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>simply because nobody told me not to,</span> I decided to track down the people who made Clifford, as well as some of those fans who discovered it later. <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>Actors</span> and filmmakers, viewers with unexpected connections to the story, and some people with barely any relationship to it at all gathered to offer the deep cinematic analysis Ebert suggested and Clifford — beautiful, crazy, misunderstood&nbsp;Clifford —&nbsp;deserves.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckrc4orgb002w3h6e35fijqun@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Oh, That’s Gonna Bomb”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7ce5000s3h6fuftxfftv@published data-word-count=59>For many of the people I spoke with, it had been years since they’d talked about Clifford — if they were ever asked to talk about the movie at all. To tell the story, it is necessary to go back to the very beginnings of the idea for the film. Which, surprisingly, predated even the involvement of Martin Short.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0d00183h6fftpyh8d3@published data-word-count=40><strong>Steven Kampmann (co-writer, Clifford): </strong>You’re the first person I’ve talked to about this at all. And not because I’m sensitive. It’s just … there’s no reason to discuss it.

I guess I always thought it was funny. We decided to pitch it to Orion [Pictures], where we had done <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>Back to School,</span> so they were friendly about hearing from us. Will’s next-door neighbor’s son was named Clifford, and so we named the movie after him.

Will and I loved to do the pitches. We’d basically outline where we wanted it to go. It wasn’t every perfect scene, but it was enough to know the basic structure of it so they could see it. They got the comedy of it. I was coming off a movie that I co-directed with Will, called <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-7 tabindex=0>Stealing Home.</span> Will wasn’t as interested in directing as I was; he was kind of a writer’s writer, so I wanted to direct it.

When we wrote together, we recognized that the voice that we used was neither his nor mine but kind of a unique voice. Because we performed for two years together many, many hundreds of shows and improvs, we had a very easy way of improvising. I would say, in general, in my career, I’ve been considered the structure person. Will had a great strength for dialogue. And together, we both had a good sense of building the character. So our process was we would leave town, and we took with us a guy named John Bates — who also has passed away, unfortunately — and we would go to the mountains. Will and I would sit in different seats, and we would then do dialogue, and John would get it down on the computer. What was remarkable about our process was the quantity of work we could do. We generally would go to Taos, New Mexico, for a week at the most. We always returned with a script of at least 120 pages. And that was the process on Clifford.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0y001g3h6fkbe9djfk@published data-word-count=59><strong>Marc Platt (then-president of production at Orion Pictures): </strong>As I recall, the producers of the film were Larry Brezner, who has since passed, and Buddy Morra, who were managers.

Larry developed this script, and he invited me in as his co-producing partner. I became aware of the script and I thought it was hilarious.

I read it for the first time just now, which is strange because we saw most films together.&nbsp;Every so often, a movie would strike Roger this way, and he would just write a review that was probably as painful for him to write as it was for the filmmakers to read. He, of course, wanted to like all the movies he saw.
